    <li>Why is your website so terrible?
    We couldn't afford a real web developer so we had our friend's cousin, Rosie, who's studying that kind of stuff to build it for us. Don't worry, once she gets better this site will look real spiffy!</li>
    
    <li>Do you really put salmon in your cookies?
    Why, yes, yes we do! It is ground up real fine so you won't taste it too much!</li>

    <li>How did you come up with the idea to put salmon in cookies?
    It was a spur of the moment thought. Pat was running low on ingredients to add to cookies and had some leftover ground up salmon he was using for a dry rub experiment. He added some to cookies and what do you know, they weren't too bad. His family thought so too! And from there on his normal run of the mill cookie shop transformed. He sold his first batch on November 1st, 2012. People kept coming back and asking for the cookies and now that's what we are known for. Funny story isn't it?</li>

    <li>Do you cater?
    Yes! However, orders under 50 cookies must be placed at least 48 hours in advance. Anything more than that requires 7 days advance notice.</li>

    <li>Can I have my party in your bakery?
    No can do amigo! We do however have private rooms you can rent by the hour for studying, meetings or eating your cookies without the kiddos outside staring longingly.</li>

    <li>How much does it cost to rent the study room?
    Rates vary by location. We currently do not have them available on the website, so please call your local Pat's Salmon Cookies to find out.</li>

    <li>How many people can fit in the study room?
    We have various sizes. Our smallest room can hold 5 people and our biggest, holds 10. Each comes with a whiteboard, markers, erases, a long table and comfy chairs.</li>

    <li>But you're a bakery, why have a study room?
    Well that's another funny story! We had a lot of students studying who could not put all of their things on the round desks and we thought "Hey, since people like to use coffee shops and bakeries to study, why not provide a space that is more accomodating?" and from there came the study room idea!</li>
